            It was ceded to the Bahmani Kings by Deo Rai, Rajah of Warangal during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah of the 
            Bahmani Sultanate.
            Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as
            the Governor of Hyderabad by the Bahmani Kings, fortified city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate.</p>

        <p>The Golden Temple is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.
            It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism.
            It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Kartarpur, and
            Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.
            The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.
            In 1604, Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib and is 
            the prominent figure in the development of gurudwara who built it in the 16th Century.</p>

        <h2>RED FORT</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Delhi_fort.jpg/1200px-Delhi_fort.jpg" alt="place5">
        <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, 
           that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. 
           Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital
           from Agra to Delhi. 
           Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal.
           The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with
           Indian traditions.</p>
